# patterns_codelab

You successfully experimented with patterns, records, enhanced switch and case, and sealed classes. You covered a lot of informationâ€”but only barely scratched the surface of these features. For more information on patterns, see the [feature specification](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/blob/master/accepted/future-releases/0546-patterns/feature-specification.md).

The different pattern types, different contexts in which they can appear, and the potential nesting of subpatterns make the possibilities in behavior seemingly endless. But they're easy to see.

You can imagine all kinds of ways to display content in Flutter using patterns. Using patterns, you can safely extract data in order to build your UI in a few lines of code.

## What's next?

- Check out the documentation on patterns, records, enhanced switch and cases, and class modifiers in the [Language section](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/blob/master/accepted/future-releases/0546-patterns/feature-specification.md) of the Dart documentation.
